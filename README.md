# NYC MVA model

Between 2012 and 2020, there were close to 2 million motor vehicle accidents in New York City. A significant number of these accidents involved non-drivers, such as pedestrians, cyclists, etc. This model attempts to predict accidents involving pedestrians, with the purpose of determining patterns for new traffic recommendations and police presence.

The data was collected a number of months ago from the [NYC OpenData](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95) dataset. The dataset is constantly updated, and as such, the current data contains more accidents than the models trained here. 

The data contains geographical and borough information, along with date and time of each accident. A contributing factor was applied to each accident, as well as the vehicle types. The data set also contains the number of persons injured or killed; these are then broken down into pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists injured or killed. To develop a target, I combined` the `NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS INJURED`, `NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS KILLED`, `NUMBER OF CYCLISTS INJURED`, and `NUMBER OF CYCLISTS KILLED`  into a single column called `TOTAL PEDESTRIAN CASUALTIES`. I then created the target based on the nonzero records contained in the `TOTAL PEDESTRIAN CASUALTIES` column, simply called `CASUALTIES?` and containing a 1 for all nonzero records, and a 0 for all others.
